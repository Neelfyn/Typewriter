			"Markdown lets you create richtext documents by entering text in a simple format that's easy to read and write. No bells and whistles, just you and your text.\n"+
			"\n"+
			"To create a document simply\n"+
			"\n"+
			" 1. Type Markdown text [in the editor][editor]\n"+
			" 2. Preview the document after [dragging up the toolbar][preview]\n"+
			" \n"+
			"Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][markdown]:\n"+
			"\n"+
			"> The overriding design goal for Markdown's\n"+
			"> formatting syntax is to make it as readable \n"+
			"> as possible. The idea is that a\n"+
			"> Markdown-formatted document should be\n"+
			"> publishable as-is, as plain text, without\n"+
			"> looking like it's been marked up with tags\n"+
			"> or formatting instructions.\n"+
			"\n"+
			"This document is written in Markdown; you are currently seeing the preview. To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, *pull down the toolbar* and have a look.\n"+
			"\n"+
			"What next?\n"+
			"----------\n"+
			"\n"+
			"Go right ahead, create a new document and start typing. And don't mind the style, just mind your words. It'll come out alright by itself.\n"+
			"\n"+
			"Once you've done a few lines you can sync the document back and forth with Dropbox so you can continue working with your text wherever you are.\n"+
